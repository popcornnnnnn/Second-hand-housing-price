# Second-hand-housing-price
This study identifies and quantifies the main factors affecting second-hand housing prices by integrating a robust dataset and applying multiple machine learning methods. Rather than focusing on the novelty of the model, the emphasis is placed on how data quality, contextual relevance, and well-chosen explanatory variables drive prediction accuracy. Employing a range of techniques, including random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting, the results show that the random forest model attains the lowest normalized mean squared error (approximately 0.52). Crucial factors—such as neighborhood attributes, building height, unit size, and proximity to educational facilities—contribute over 60% to the gain in predictive performance. Nonlinear marginal effects reveal key thresholds, with property values responding sharply to increments in nearby schools and displaying notable variation as building height changes. Although this analysis is based on a single urban housing market, the general approach and insights are readily transferable, offering policymakers, investors, and researchers a blueprint for understanding and forecasting housing prices in diverse contexts worldwide.
